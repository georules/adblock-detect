adblock-detect
==============

This is a small script to help detect if someone is running adblock.  test.html shows an example use.

If used, it should be compiled with another important script, as someone could simply adblock the detector script.

TODO: make use of a blocked script or filename that does not require checking against another server, or which might be used by the website to avoid double-loading.
